Write a R program to find elements which are present in two given data frames.
Output:
[1] "Original Dataframes"
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"
[1] "d" "e" "f" "g"
[1] "Elements which are present in both dataframe:"
[1] "d" "e"
source code:
df1 <- data.frame(x = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
df2 <- data.frame(x = c("d", "e", "f", "g"))
cat("Original Dataframes\n")
print(df1$x)
print(df2$x)
common <- intersect(df1$x, df2$x)
cat("Elements which are present in both data frames:\n")
print(common)
