SOURCE CODE:
                                    str(mpg)
This code will output the structure of the "mpg" dataset, including the data type of each variable. Based on this output, we can identify the categorical variables as those with a data type of "factor" or "character," while the continuous variables will have a data type of "numeric." Here is the list of variables and their data types:

Categorical variables:

manufacturer (character)
model (character)
displ (numeric, but can be treated as categorical if we group by engine size)
year (numeric)
cyl (numeric)
trans (character)
drv (character)
class (character)
Continuous variables:

cty (numeric)
hwy (numeric)
Based on this information, we can conclude that there are eight categorical variables and two continuous variables in the "mpg" dataset.
